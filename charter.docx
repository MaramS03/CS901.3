Goals

1.  Understand and apply the principles of scrum: The team should aim to understand the principles of scrum, including roles, events, and artifacts. 
    We should implement these principles throughout the software development lifecycle to ensure effective project management, collaboration, and 
    continuous improvement.

2.  Learn from feedback and adapt to changes: The team should aim to learn from feedback and adapt to changes throughout the software development lifecycle.
    We should seek feedback from team members and use it to improve the product and the sprint process. We should also be open to changes in project 
    requirements and adjust their approach accordingly, while keeping the project on track and within the sprint timeline.
