Goals

1.  Understand and apply the principles of scrum: The team should aim to understand the principles of scrum, including roles, events, and artifacts. 
    We should implement these principles throughout the software development lifecycle to ensure effective project management, collaboration, and 
    continuous improvement.

2.  Learn from feedback and adapt to changes: The team should aim to learn from feedback and adapt to changes throughout the software development lifecycle.
    We should seek feedback from team members and use it to improve the product and the sprint process. We should also be open to changes in project 
    requirements and adjust their approach accordingly, while keeping the project on track and within the sprint timeline.

Work Expectations

1.  Time Commitments

    It is expected that each member of the Scrum team will commit to a certain amount of time each week for the project (variable according to availability). 
    This time commitment includes not only the time spent on completing tasks, but also time spent on attending meetings, collaborating with other team members, providing feedback, and participating in other project-related activities.

2.  Differences in Work Habits

    The work habits of any particular member will not be an issue as long as the member communicates progress, produces quality work, 
    and the work is done by the dates established by the group. If the member does not meet these standards, procedures to deal with that 
    member are further detailed in the ground rules.
