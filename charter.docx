Goals

1.  Understand and apply the principles of scrum: The team should aim to understand the principles of scrum, including roles, events, and artifacts. 
    We should implement these principles throughout the software development lifecycle to ensure effective project management, collaboration, and 
    continuous improvement.

2.  Learn from feedback and adapt to changes: The team should aim to learn from feedback and adapt to changes throughout the software development lifecycle.
    We should seek feedback from team members and use it to improve the product and the sprint process. We should also be open to changes in project 
    requirements and adjust their approach accordingly, while keeping the project on track and within the sprint timeline.

Work Expectations

1.  Time Commitments

    It is expected that each member of the Scrum team will commit to a certain amount of time each week for the project (variable according to availability). 
    This time commitment includes not only the time spent on completing tasks, but also time spent on attending meetings, collaborating with other team members, 
    providing feedback, and participating in other project-related activities.

2.  Differences in Work Habits

    The work habits of any particular member will not be an issue as long as the member communicates progress, produces quality work, 
    and the work is done by the dates established by the group. If the member does not meet these standards, procedures to deal with that 
    member are further detailed in the ground rules.

Ground Rules

1.  Meetings

    a.  General
    
    A meeting should generally take up to 1 hour. A meeting may take longer but it is discouraged. One meeting a week is required though the 
    group may schedule additional if scheduling allows. Meetings are to facilitate communication and establish direction for the project going forward.
    Beyond the scheduled time of a meeting members are free to leave to prevent conflicting obligations without incurring any offenses. 
    
    
Group communication and interaction:

1. Regular communication:

    Have some sort of communication with the rest of the team atleast once a week.
    
2. Decision Making:

    Any decisions which need to be made about the project, project direction or disciplinary
    action will be made by a majority vote.
    
3. Group Decision on Delegations:

    The delegation of responsibilities to group members will be decided in the following
    fashion. The responsibilities will be discussed and decided on as a group decision. Then
    each group member has the opportunity to volunteer for the task he may want. If a group
    member feels the portion of responsibility is unfair, they may voice their concern and
    state a reason why. If a majority of the group feels this member is correct, the
    responsibilities will be reformed and the delegation process will start again.
